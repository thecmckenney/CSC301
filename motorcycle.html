  <p>BMW is not just known for their cars, they also are a top manufacturer of motorcycles of all sorts. BMW motorcycles became reality in 1923 and are still in full swing almost a century later.</p>

    <p>BMW rolled their first bike off the production line in 1923. By 1929, they had produced the fastest motorcycle in the world at the time. In 1935 they were the first manufacturer to use a hydraulic telescopic fork. In 1937 they set another speed record. Ernst Henne set the fastest speed on two wheels at 279.5 kph and this record held for 14 years. In the 1950s, BMW was using shaft driven motorcycles, instead of chain drive, for their racing applications. In 1991, they produced their millionth motorcycle and they have only grown more from there, continuing to innovate the world of motorcycles.
